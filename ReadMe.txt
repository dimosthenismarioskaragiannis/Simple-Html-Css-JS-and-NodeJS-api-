This is a simple "Ecommerce" website created with plain old Html Css and Javascript. It is served by a Node JS api.. 
There is nothing fancy about this project, nor it demonstrates any skill , the only reason it is here its due to emotional attachment,
as it was my first experience developing a "fullstack web app". Found it randomly in one of my local folders, and i would like to pay my respects to this assignment because it made me love web development.
